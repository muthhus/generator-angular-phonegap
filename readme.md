# AngularJS Phonegap generator

## WARNING

I realize that this project will be hell to maintain. 
The current release will be the last one. I'm sorry to everyone who
already built on it. 

You can now use  __[dsimard/grunt-angular-phonegap](https://github.com/dsimard/grunt-angular-phonegap)__
which is simpler, more robust and easier to maintain.

Contact me at <dsimard@azanka.ca> if you need
help to switch to the new project.

## Usage

Make sure `phonegap` and `cordova` is installed:
```
npm install -g phonegap
```

Install `generator-angular-phonegap`:
```
npm install -g generator-angular-phonegap
```

Create a new phonegap project and `cd` into it:
```
phonegap create --name MyApp --id com.yourcompany.myapp myapp
cd myapp
```

Add the phonegap platform you need (to see available platforms, `phonegap --help`):
```
cordova platform add android
```

Run `yo angular-phonegap`, optionally passing an app name:
```
yo angular-phonegap:app [app-name]
```

Run the local server:
```
grunt server
```

Build and send to emulator:
```
grunt build:phonegap
cordova emulate android
```

## Generators

Available generators:

* [angular-phonegap](#app) (aka [angular-phonegap:app](#app))
* [angular-phonegap:controller](#controller)
* [angular-phonegap:directive](#directive)
* [angular-phonegap:filter](#filter)
* [angular-phonegap:route](#route)
* [angular-phonegap:service](#service)
* [angular-phonegap:provider](#service)
* [angular-phonegap:factory](#service)
* [angular-phonegap:value](#service)
* [angular-phonegap:constant](#service)
* [angular-phonegap:decorator] (#decorator)
* [angular-phonegap:view](#view)

**Note: Generators are to be run from the root directory of your app.**

### App
Sets up a new AngularJS app, generating all the boilerplate you need to get started. The app generator also optionally installs Twitter Bootstrap and additional AngularJS modules, such as angular-resource.

Example:
```bash
yo angular
```

### Route
Generates a controller and view, and configures a route in `app/scripts/app.js` connecting them.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-phonegap:route myroute
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/myroute.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyrouteCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```

Produces `app/views/myroute.html`:
```html
<p>This is the myroute view</p>
```

### Controller
Generates a controller in `app/scripts/controllers`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-phonegap:controller user
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/user.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('UserCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```
### Directive
Generates a directive in `app/scripts/directives`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-phonegap:directive myDirective
```

Produces `app/scripts/directives/myDirective.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').directive('myDirective', function () {
  return {
    template: '<div></div>',
    restrict: 'E',
    link: function postLink(scope, element, attrs) {
      element.text('this is the myDirective directive');
    }
  };
});
```

### Filter
Generates a filter in `app/scripts/filters`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-phonegap:filter myFilter
```

Produces `app/scripts/filters/myFilter.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').filter('myFilter', function () {
  return function (input) {
    return 'myFilter filter:' + input;
  };
});
```

### View
Generates an HTML view file in `app/views`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-phonegap:view user
```

Produces `app/views/user.html`:
```html
<p>This is the user view</p>
```

### Service
Generates an AngularJS service.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-phonegap:service myService
```

Produces `app/scripts/services/myService.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').service('myService', function () {
  // ...
});
```

You can also do `yo angular-phonegap:factory`, `yo angular-phonegap:provider`, `yo angular-phonegap:value`, and `yo angular-phonegap:constant` for other types of services.

### Decorator
Generates an AngularJS service decorator.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-phonegap:decorator serviceName
```

Produces `app/scripts/decorators/serviceNameDecorator.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').config(function ($provide) {
    $provide.decorator('serviceName', function ($delegate) {
      // ...
      return $delegate;
    });
  });
```

## Options
In general, these options can be applied to any generator, though they only affect generators that produce scripts.

### CoffeeScript
For generators that output scripts, the `--coffee` option will output CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript.

For example:
```bash
yo angular-phonegap:controller user --coffee
```

Produces `app/scripts/controller/user.coffee`:
```coffeescript
angular.module('myMod')
  .controller 'UserCtrl', ($scope) ->
```

A project can mix CoffeScript and JavaScript files.

To output JavaScript files, even if CoffeeScript files exist (the default is to output CoffeeScript files if 
the generator finds any in the project), use `--coffee=false`.

### Minification Safe
By default, generators produce unannotated code. Without annotations, AngularJS's DI system will break when minified. Typically, these annotations that make minification safe are added automatically at build-time, after application files are concatenated, but before they are minified. By providing the `--minsafe` option, the code generated will out-of-the-box be ready for minification. The trade-off is between amount of boilerplate, and build process complexity.

#### Example
```bash
yo angular-phonegap:controller user --minsafe
```

Produces `app/controller/user.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('UserCtrl', ['$scope', function ($scope) {
  // ...
}]);
```

#### Background
Unannotated:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyCtrl', function ($scope, $http, myService) {
  // ...
});
```

Annotated:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyCtrl',
  ['$scope', '$http', 'myService', function ($scope, $http, myService) {

    // ...
  }]);
```

The annotations are important because minified code will rename variables, making it impossible for AngularJS to infer module names based solely on function parameters.

The recommended build process uses `ngmin`, a tool that automatically adds these annotations. However, if you'd rather not use `ngmin`, you have to add these annotations manually yourself.

### Add to Index
By default, new scripts are added to the index.html file. However, this may not always be suitable. Some use cases:

* Manually added to the file
* Auto-added by a 3rd party plugin
* Using this generator as a subgenerator

To skip adding them to the index, pass in the skip-add argument:
```bash
yo angular-phonegap:service serviceName --skip-add
```

## Bower Components

The following packages are always installed by the [app](#app) generator:

* angular
* angular-mocks
* angular-scenario


The following additional modules are available as components on bower, and installable via `bower install`:

* angular-cookies
* angular-loader
* angular-resource
* angular-sanitize

All of these can be updated with `bower update` as new versions of AngularJS are released.

## Configuration
Yeoman generated projects can be further tweaked according to your needs by modifying project files appropriately.

### Output
You can change the `app` directory by adding a `appPath` property to `bower.json`. For instance, if you wanted to easily integrate with Express.js, you could add the following:

```json
{
  "name": "yo-test",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  ...
  "appPath": "public"
}

```
This will cause Yeoman-generated client-side files to be placed in `public`.

## Testing

For tests to work properly, karma needs the `angular-mocks` bower package.
This script is included in the bower.json in the `devDependencies` section, which will
be available very soon, probably with the next minor release of bower.

While bower `devDependencies` are not yet implemented, you can fix it by running:
```bash
bower install angular-mocks
```

By running `grunt test` you should now be able to run your unit tests with karma.
